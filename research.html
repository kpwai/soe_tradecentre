  <!--<p>SMU Associate Professor Chang Pao-Li’s research seeks to study firms’ links to each other to map out how global disruptions affect Singapore’s economy.</p>
  <p>The global trading system has experienced unprecedented volatility since the Trump administration enacted reciprocal tariffs in April, forcing multinational enterprises (MNEs) to adjust their production strategies. American industrial giant Boeing is exploring other markets to cope with China’s retaliatory 125-percent tariffs on goods from the US, while Honda and LG are considering moving some production to the United States to sidestep the US’s additional 145-percent import tariffs on goods from China.</p>
  <p>Some Chinese companies, such as fashion label Shein, are shifting production out of China to the U.S. for similar reasons. The Nanjing-founded company, now headquartered in Singapore, generated US$38 billion in revenue in 2024 and is the primary source of business for a network of factories and related enterprises in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. These so-called “Shein villages” consist of related businesses such as garment manufacturers, design studios, quality control firms, and logistics services. The economic fallout of Shein upping sticks would be considerable, which has spurred the Chinese government to dissuade the company from doing so.</p>
  <p>How can one quantify the knock-on effects of a strategic entity such as Shein leaving? How do the shocks from a trade war transmit through an economy? Conversely, how can one measure the positive effects that an MNE may bring to the local economy, including the innovation spillovers, the productivity gains, and the potential increase in local labour demand?</p>
  <p>Those elements form the bulk of Associate Professor of Economics Chang Pao-Li’s project, “Role of Firm-to-Firm Input-Output Linkages in Transmitting Aggregate Shocks: Impacts on Firm-Level Productivity, Labor Demand, and Innovation”. Professor Chang recently clinched a Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 3 grant for the project, which seeks to understand “the mechanisms through which global shocks (such as trade wars and supply chain disruptions) propagate across firms' linkages”.</p>-->
